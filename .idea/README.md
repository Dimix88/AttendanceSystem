Student Attendance.

Problem Specification

School attendance is of paramount importance and could make or break a learnings working career.  In South Africa most schools make use of a manual system of to log attendance.  This system is can become very expensive, time consuming and difficult to navigate.  Paper or books need to be bought to be used for registers, these documents need to be stored, thus storage space can become and really large headache.  With this way of marking attendance, it becomes hard to retrieve individual and meaningful data for decision making, like which learners are repeat offenders and which learners need special attention with regard to this issue.  

The system will be used to mark the attendance of students electronically and potentially alleviate many of the problems being experienced by the current attendance marking system.  With the system lecturers will mark the attendance of the students and they will also be able to rectify mistakes.  A lecturer will be able to add and delete student accounts/profiles.  They will also be able to view the attendance figures of the students in order to report to parents or in case the principal requests these figures.  The students will be able to view their attendance figures, but they will not be allowed to make changes to these figures.
